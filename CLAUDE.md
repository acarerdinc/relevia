NEVER EVER USE DIRECTLY AI RELATED FILTERS OR RULES IN THE CODE SINCE WE MIGHT CHANGE THE ROOT TOPIC TO SOME OTHER TOPIC IN THE FUTURE.
Never use fallback mechanisms unless explicitly requested.
Avoid temporary fixes. When the user gives an example error, find the root cause and fix it.
Don't create solutions for specific examples for bugs, find the root cause and fix the general issue.
NEVER USE FALLBACK MECHANISMS!
Always push to dev branch unless otherwise specified differently.
Never add initial subtopics or questions to the database. Everything should be dynamic.
