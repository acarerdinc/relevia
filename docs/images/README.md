# Documentation Images

This directory contains screenshots and images used in the project documentation.

## Adding Screenshots

To add the question diversity example screenshot:

1. Save your screenshot as `question-diversity-example.png` in this directory
2. The README.md already references this image path
3. The image should show an example of the sophisticated, diverse questions generated by the system

## Current Images

- `question-diversity-example.png` - Example of advanced question generation (to be added)

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include alt text in markdown references
