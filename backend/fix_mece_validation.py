Fix overly strict MECE validation that's preventing subtopic generation
"""

# The issue is that the MECE validator is checking for substring matches of problematic pairs
# without considering context. For example, under "Machine Learning" topic, having subtopics
# with "machine learning" in their names (like "Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning")
# is perfectly valid and doesn't violate MECE principles.

# The fix is to:
# 1. Make the validation context-aware of the parent topic
# 2. Only flag true overlaps, not contextual uses of terms
# 3. Focus on actual conceptual overlaps rather than keyword matching

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The MECE validation in dynamic_topic_generator.py is too strict. It's using simple substring
matching to detect overlaps, which causes false positives.

For example, under "Machine Learning" parent topic:
- "Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning" 
- "Deep Learning Architectures"

These are flagged as overlapping because they contain "machine learning" and "deep learning",
but they're actually distinct, non-overlapping subtopics.

SOLUTION:
The validation needs to be more intelligent:
1. Consider the parent topic context
2. Look for actual conceptual overlaps, not just keyword matches
3. Allow terms from the parent topic to appear in subtopic names

The fix should modify the _validate_mece_principles method to:
- Skip validation for terms that are part of the parent topic name
- Use more sophisticated overlap detection
- Focus on actual MECE violations rather than keyword presence
